Dispatcher invocation:
* ./dispatcher -h explains basic command line parameters

Dispatcher control interface:
* SIGHUP - safely reload configuration file (dispatcher.conf)
* SIGTERM - gracefully terminate, wait for all children to finish
* SIGUSR1,SIGUSR2 - pause, unpause dispatching

Many aspects of logging can be adjusted using configuration file, look for
specific help in the dispatcher.conf file.
